                      Sea-Bites was a project I got to work on during my UX elective at UTS. In collaboration with
                      M&amp;C Saatchi and Minderoo we developed a concept to solve a problem statement and promote ocean
                      conservation by 2026. Our deliverable was a concept pitch showcasing our idea for endangered
                      animal shaped sushi lunchbox kits to raise ocean awareness from kids at a young age.

                    Using the double diamond technique, we conducted extensive research, including interviews, POV
                    statements, HMW questions, surveys, persona creation, and empathy mapping. Our goal was to develop a
                    solution that would encourage users to &#34;Understand, love and act for a flourishing ocean&#34;.
                    After a thorough analysis of our research findings, we identified an effective solution: creating a
                    sushi kit for primary school children that would introduce more sustainable seafood into their diets
                    in a fun and engaging way.

                I particularly enjoyed this process of designing an approach that led to a more refined and informed
                design process, in which we were able to start to shape our project based of our personas that we
                created based of interviews we undertook on real target audiences from the public. Our concept to
                connect children to the ocean through seafood developed after user research to reveal seafood is absent
                in a lot of young children&#39;s diets. Sea-Bites aims to instil the love for seafood and the ocean by
                educating them at a young age.

              The Seabites concept utilizes kits available at Woolworths to create endangered sea creatures, teaching
              kids about the importance of the ocean while promoting healthy eating habits. We were thrilled to be able
              to use our design skills to make a positive impact on the environment and inspire future generations to
              care for the ocean.

              This project allowed me to experience the UX design Process in full depth which has impacted the way I see
              UX design now on a daily basis. I always thought the solution to every problem was digital
              but&nbsp;&nbsp;after our extensive research in this project it was apparent that that is not always the
              case. The experience start to finish was very helpful for my design practice and it was a fun project to
              work on.
